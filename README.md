# Smart_Parking-Database-Managemnt-System
We have created a database managment system for smart parking lots consisting of features like ANPR(Automatic Number Plate Recognition) cameras and RFID based automatic entry and various modes of payment like RFID, online banking, card or cash with the help of Automatic Pay Machine at the time of exit.


Steps to run queries and test the database

Run “Final_db.sql” in “MySQL Workbench” to create schema and tables along with data preinserted.
Open query files from “Queries/SQL_files” to run queries on that database.
“Queries/Output photots” contains snapshots of the output of SQL queries.
“Tables_csv” contains CSV files of data of all SQL tables.
“Entries_data” contains information about number of rows and columns in each table and total number of entries in the database.
